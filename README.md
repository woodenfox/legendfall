# Introduction
Legendfall is a strategy tabletop role-playing game about adventuring through a world of legends and villains. It’s about co-creating a universe through the journeys and decisions your characters make. When you open your first Legendfall Origin pack, your character is born.  As a strategy game, players have the ability to craft a unique character, with a unique set of abilities, and tweak and adjust that character as they grow. As a roleplaying game, players walk the journey of a hero in a harsh world filled with corruption and redemption.

# Getting Started
The promise of Legendfall is a game that you can learn by plying rather than requiring a deep knowledge of one or more rulebooks. The game is best started with Encounter 0 (https://www.legendfall.com/encounter-0), this setup encounter will walk you through character creation and bring you into the universe. The first 10 Encounters are designed to give you not only an introduction to the game but also build your map and monster library so that you can create and improvose your own encounters.

# Mastergear
Legendfall is brought to life by giving players special roles. When a player takes on a role, their character holds a piece of equipment known as Mastergear. If you are playing with more than four players, one or more players may not have mastergear, but that’s ok! Roles are not fixed; players can swap Mastergear at the start of each encounter.
* **The Storyteller** - This player is the voice of the narrator, NPCs, and sets the difficulty of any social interaction checks. The most important quality of a Storyteller is a strong/clear voice. The storyteller is a social and charaisma focused role, less focused on the rules.
* **The Wayfinder** - The Wayfinder controls the environment and sets the diffullty of all checks related to moving and interacting with the world. For example, if a player asks "can I move here" or "is this difficult terrain," the Wayfinder makes the final decision. ![Wayfinder Card](https://cdn.legendfall.com/cardImages/final/300dpi/mastergear-wayfinder.jpg)
* **The Beastheart** - Player who holds the Beastheart controls enemeies in encounters and ensures encounters are deadly and brilliant. This particular role is best held by a player who has experience with a game like D&D or Magic the Gathering as it requires a deeper understanding of rules, mechanics, and how cards might interact.
* **The Titanback** - The Titanback is the quartermaster and tactition for the team, they manage any treasure, XP, equipment, and manage a variety of party resources and needs. This role belongs to your most organized player, the kind of person who takes notes and likes to put everything in it's right place.

## Character Creation

Your GM provides you with a single pack of cards called an Origin Pack. This gives you an assortment of cards that lay the foundation for a character. It’s everything you need to play. As you look through your pack, look for cards labeled: Ancestry, Background, and Trait. Let the other players know what you got (e.g., “I’ve got a Ork Mastermind Smuggler”). Don't worry about trying to understand what these cards do at this stage, you will learn that later. You can keep exactly the cards you open or trade cards with other players.

## Your First Encounter
Put your Weapons, Armor, and Ancestry cards face up on the table (“in play”). The rest of the cards are your deck; they start face down. You will draw from these each turn.

### Your First Turn
Not sure what to do your first turn? Moving and attacking an enemy is a great place to start:

1. Look at your armor to see how many squares you can move. Move towards an enemy counting your squares of movement. Moving in any direction (including diagonal) counts as one square of movement.
2. Choose one of your weapons and attack by following the rules on the card. Legendfall is played almost exclusively with 20 sided dice, henceforth referred to as a d20. Weapon attacks always require you to roll a d20. When you see a label like "10+" this means to follow the directions on the card if you rolled a 10 or higher. Your attack will always hit unless something is done in response to prevent it.
3. At the end of your turn, draw 1 card from your deck. Say "I'm drawing my card" or "Pass turn" to signal it is the next players turn.
<br>

### Defending Against Attacks
When you're under attack, your armor comes in handy. Read your armor card. If there is a Defense value, reduce damage dealt to you by that amount. A character only has one defense at any given time. If an ability grants you a higher defense than your current defense, defer to the highest value. You can't wear more than one set of armor.

### Role-playing
Legendfall is a collaborative role-playing game. Do your best to think from your characters perspective as you fight alongside your party. A player might shout, “Lerik, let’s get the big guy together.” If someone jumps in to help you, say thank you and remember to use their character name. Talking "in character" takes time to learn. You don't have to talk using your characters voice in order to roleplay; you can describe what your character is feeling and doing: "Kirin looks with vengeful eyes at the big wolf who just took a bite out of Lerik."

### Your Next Turns
In addition to moving a number of squares equal to the "Move" value on your armor, you can take three other actions in a round: one **standard action** (e.g., use your weapon), one **swift action**, and one **immediate action**. Immediate actions can be used anytime, even during your opponents turn; you can say: “Before that happens, I use an immediate action.” (A deeper exploration can be found in Actions, page 3).

The vast majority of the rules in Legendfall are baked into each characters cards. If your confused or unsure at anytime about what something means, ask your GM.

On your next turns, here are a few things to try: 

* Use an ability card you drew from your deck. Pay attention to what type of action it uses (e.g., standard, swift, or immediate). Remember, you get one of each action each turn. Most ability cards are put in your discard pile after being used. 
* Move. Attack. And move again. Sometimes the best way to stay safe is to attack and then move somewhere safe.
* Team up with an ally and fight side by side or back to back (it's the safest way to fight).
* Try to use an immediate action during an ally or enemie's turn. Try to think of a moment when you can say, ”Before that happens, I...”

Your limit of one standard, swift, and immediate action resets at the beginning of your turn. If you've used all your actions, you'll need to wait a full round for them to reset.

### When you Run Out of Cards
When you run out of cards, your character is exhausted. You can still fight, but won't have any cards to draw.

### Resting After the Encounter

Everything stays in play when the encounter ends, the battle might continue. To get your cards back your party needs to rest for 1 hour. When you do, shuffle all cards into your deck and reset any counters on yoru cards.

# Leveling Up

Leveling up is about growing your character, gaining new abilities, and becoming a better teammate. Each time you gain a level you add new cards to your deck via **Class Packs**. When you reach the 3rd level, you can optimize your character further by removing some of the basic starting cards from your deck.

### Gaining Experience

When you complete an encounter, your GM will give you one or more experience cards. You can spend your experience between encounters to level up by simply handing experience cards totaling to the experience cost required for your next level to your GM. See the Leveling Table below.

## How to Level Up

Each time your character levels up, you may open a new Class Pack of your choice. You may choose any class pack at each level, changing your class at anytime, although new players should generally stick to one class. The table below outlines the leveling progression and some Level Abilities gained at each level. For example, at 2nd level you will start to draw cards at the beginning of combat.

## Class Packs

Each time you level up you open a new Class Pack and add it to your deck (5 new ability cards). Legendfall isn't made to force you to buy hundreds of packs. GMs are encouraged to make their own resealable packs as they recycle old characters for future play.

### Choosing Your Class
 Each class suits a unique style of play. Choose a class that aligns with how you want to play.

* **Rogue** (Fighter / Ninja) - Melee focused, Rogues aim to make big strikes and then fade into the shadows. While they have a talent for avoiding damage, their abilities come at a great cost to their own life force. Rogues flank their opponents and make aggressive assaults, depending on invisibility, their defensive abilities, and an occasional heal from an ally to stay alive.
* **Warden** (Ranger / Druid) - Ranged focused, Wardens rely on arrows, nature magic, and animal companions. Rangers attack with devastating ranged attacks while keeping their allies alive with emergency healing.
* **Vitalist** (Monk / Cleric) - Melee focused, Vitalists are masters of life, death, and melee fist and foot combat. Vitalists manipulate the life energies of those around them with their strikes, both damaging enemies and healing allies in the same stride.
* **Mage** (Wizard / Warlock) - Ranged magic focused, mages leverage their mastery of current to manipulate the world around them. Energy blasts, mind control, and powerful artifacts are their bread and butter.
* **Marshal** (Paladin / Bard) - Melee focused, Marshals are specialists in protecting their allies and manipulating crowds of enemies. When needed, Marshals are willing to sacrifice themselves to keep the heat off their allies. Marshals have a talent for defense that keeps them and others alive.

### Build Points
As you gain levels and explore the world you'll discover powerful talents and abilities. Build points measure your characters power, balancing it along with your allies. Look in the bottom right corner of your cards and you'll see a number circled, this is the cost of your card in build points. Count the build points on all your cards, they may not exceed your current HP / Build Point Max for your level.

<div class='classTable wide'>

##### Leveling Table
| Level | XP Cost | Gained | Base HP / Build Point Max | Equipment Tier
|:---:|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|

# Actions

As you begin to become more serious about Legendfall, the ability to optimzie your actions each turn becomes increasingly important. This section aims to take you a layer deepr into the nuances of each of the action types and how they work in a variety of situations. Don't feel overwhelmed as you read this section, many of these rules are advanced and will be brought up by your GM exclusively when their needed later in the game.

## Action Types

* **Standard Actions** - Each character may take one standard action during their turn. If a player doesn't have a standard action card in their hand, they can make a standard attack with one of their weapons. A player may always sacrifice their standard action in exchange for an additional move, swift, or immediate action.

* **Move Actions** - Each character may move during their turn. Typically a player may move a number of squares (including diagonals) as is marked on their armor. A character wearing no armor may move up to 7 squares during their turn. Characters may move through allies squares as if that ally we’re not there, but they may not move through enemy squares. A player may not end their turn standing in a square shared by an enemy or allie. Moving through water or climbing costs additional movement. (See Difficult Terrain, page 5). A player can take other actions in the middle of their movement. For example, move 3 squares, use a standard action to heal an ally, and move another 4 squares.

* **Swift Actions** - Each character may take one swift action during their turn. These are typically quick support abilities.

* **Immediate Actions** - Each character may take one immediate action per-round during another player or enemies turn. These are often disruptive or life-saving abilities. A player may choose to use their immediate action during their own turn if they so choose. Like all other actions, once a player has used their immediate action for the round, it is refreshed at the beginning of their turn.

* **Free Actions** - Players may take an unlimited number of free actions.

## Attacking
In Legendfall all attacks are assumed to hit unless the character you are attacking does something (e.g., uses an ability) or there are circumstances in the combat that might cause a player to miss (e.g., a dense fog covers the battlefield, you must roll high to hit). Attacks follow a simple pattern:

1. **Choose a target and announce your attack.** Pick an enemy within the reach of your attack. Melee attacks typically require you to be adjacent to the enemy. Ranged attacks specify their range on the card.
2. **Roll attack dice.** Roll damage dice as described in the attack.
3. **Pause for reactions** Many immediate actions can manipulate or even prevent damage after it has been rolled.
4. **Resolve damage and defence.** Subtract defence from the attack damage and apply any other effects.

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>

> * Zoe: “I’m attacking the dark knight who just hurt Dina, I’ll use my short sword.”
> * Dina: “That guy is going down! Before Zoe attacks I use an immediate action to summon a Giant Bird behind the dark knight--this gives Zoe an additional 1 damage on her attack.”
> * Zoe: “By the might of the eagle I banish thee! I rolled a 6, plus one for the eagle--that’s 7 damage. Woot!”
> * GM: “The dark knight is dealt a fearsome blow, his armor soaks 3 of your damage, but he takes 4 and falls to his knees blood gushing from his neck--he’s dead.”

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>

### Weapons & Ability Cards
Players with weapons in play may always take a standard action to use their weapon. Many standard actions in your deck will include phrases like this “Weapon damage +1”. This means that your ability is executed using your weapon. In these circumstances, you should follow the rules of both your weapon card and the card you are playing.

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>

>* Zoe: “I’m going to use my Sneak Attack on the goblin, attacking with my short sword”
> * GM: “Go for it."
>* Zoe: “Sneak Attack lets me deal Weapon Damage + 2. My shortsword deals 1d6 damage and an additional 2 damage if I roll a 1. I just rolled a 1. So my weapon deals 3 damage and I get an extra plus two for my sneak attack. Hey, that's 5 damage--not bad!”

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>

### Responding to Attacks
If an immediate action is used that makes an attack miss or otherwise impossible (e.g, the target is no longer in line of site), the attack automatically fails including any secondary effects against that target. If a player or enemy is killed in the middle of an attack, even if damage dice had already been rolled, damage and any other secondary effects are canceled.

\pagebreakNum

## Movement & Terrain
A player may move a number of squares as is marked on their armor. A character wearing no armor may move up to 7 squares. There are a few basic rules for how players move:

* A character may use a standard action to double their movement for the round
* Characters may not move through enemy squares
* Characters may move through allies squares
* Players may not end their turn in the same square with an ally or enemy 
* Moving both horizontally and diagnally costs 1 movement.

### Move, Action, Move
Players may take other actions between using their movement for the round. For example, a player might move to attack, then move around a corner to hide. Player or enemy movement may be interrupted mid-move by immediate actions. When this occurs, the remainder of that player or enemy movement may be spent after the effect is resolved. 

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>

> * GM: “The wolves move forward to attack you”
> * Zoe: “When they reach this spot, I cast Ice Wall as an immediate action to block them.”
> * GM: “The wolves are startled as huge sheets of ice slide up blocking their path, they howl and begin to circle around the ice blocks to find you, but you are too far away to attack.”

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>

### Pushing & Pulling
Many abilities specify effects like "Push 1" or "Pull 2". These effects allow you to force an enemy (or an allie) to move. The number represents the number of squares of movement they are pushed or pulled.

**Push** - A push effect must always move the target away from the source of the effect. At each step of the movement, the target must be one square further away from you--e.g., you can’t push an adjacent enemy into a different adjacent square.

**Pull** - A pull effect must always move the target towards the source of the effect. At each step of the movement, the target must be one square closer--e.g., you can’t pull an adjacent enemy into a different adjacent square.

If a character is pushed or pulled through or into a Hazard, resolve that Hazzard immediately as they enter the square.

### Hazards
Hazards represent traps, fire, lava, or any other danger within the environment that a payer or enemy might find themselves moving into or through. When Hazards are triggered, this typically results in damage to the player. Hazards are triggered in two ways:

* When a player moves into a Hazard square
* When a player ends their turn in an ongoing Hazard square (e.g., lava)

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>

### Difficult Terrain
Boulders, mud, ice, are just a few of the types of difficult terrain that may slow down players. Moving into a difficult terrain square costs no additional movement, while moving through or leaving difficult terrain costs one additional movement. For example, climbing into a river would be a normal single square of movement, wading through he water would cost two squares, and then climbing out would cost two squares for a total of five squares of movement. 

#### Swimming
Swimming follows the standard rules for difficult terrain costing one movement to enter the water, and two movement to move through or exit the water.

#### Climbing
If a character is attempting to climb, imagine if the wall itself is a square of difficult terrain. It takes one square of movement to move into this vertical square, and two squares of movement to move out of this square up on top of the wall. A player must end their turn standing flat on the surface they intend to climb or they fall.

### Falling
If a character is standing on elevated terrain and falls more than one square, they take 1d6 damage, ignoring defense, for each square they fall beyond the first. For example, a character falling from three blocks up would take 2d6 damage. A player may roll an Athetlics or Acrobatics skill check to negate this damage (10 or higher negates 1d6, 15 or higher negates 2d6).

## Line of Sight and Cover
Obstacles on the battlefield have a direct impact on your ability to target and hit enemies. Both players and enemies can “take cover” to avoid attacks and reduce the likelihood of taking damage. 

### Line of Sight
In order to target an enemy with an attack, you require a line of sight. If there is a wall directly between you and an enemy, you can’t see them, and thus can not target them with attacks. In times where it is more ambiguous whether you have a line of sight, there are some simple rules to help. As the attacker, choose a single corner of your square. If you can draw a line from that corner to at least two corners of your opponent's square without passing through a solid object, you have a line of sight. Enemies and allies between you do not block line of sight.

### Cover
When you or an enemy is partially blocked by an object, another enemy, or an ally, you have a chance of missing your target and hitting something else. When you attack an enemy, choose a corner of your square. If you can draw straight lines to at least three different corners of the enemies square without passing through an object, enemy, or allie then you have a clear shot. If you can only draw two lines, you have a 50% miss chance. If you miss, proceed as if your attack was targeting whatever object, enemy or ally caused you to miss.

For those familiar with the pen and paper role-playing terms “half-cover” and “three-quarters cover”, you can translate as follows: there is no penalty for half-cover and there is a 50% miss chance for three-quarters cover.

# Skills 1.0

Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by skills. This section explains in more detail what those skills are and the ways they are used in the game. These skills are reproduced under the OGL, with minor modifications.

Each time you gain a level you will get a "Skill Growth" card that you can trade to gain ranks in skills. Each rank you gain in a skill gives you a +2 bonus. When you roll a skill check, roll 1d20 and add your total skill bonus.

## Skill Descriptions

**_Strength_** Your Brute check covers situations in which brute force is required. For example, force open a stuck, locked, or barred door, break free of bonds, push through a tunnel that is too small, hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it, tip over a statue, keep a boulder from rolling

**_Athletics._** Your Athletics check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. For example, climbing a slippery cliff, clinging to a wall when someone is trying to knock you off, jumping an unusually long distance, swimming in treacherous waters or staying afloat when being pulled down.

**_Acrobatics._** Your Acrobatics check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. The GM might also call for an Acrobatics check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

**_Skilled Hands._** Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as: planting something on someone else, concealing an object on your person, lifting a coin purse off another person, control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent, pick a lock, disable a trap, tie up a prisoner, wriggle free of bonds, play a stringed instrument, craft a small or detailed object.

**_Stealth._** Make a Stealth check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the Perception check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.

**_Arcana._** Your Arcana check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.

**_History._** Your History check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.

**_Investigation._** When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Investigation check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Investigation check.

**_Nature._** Your Nature check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.

**_Religion._** Your Religion check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.

**_Animal Handling._** When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the GM might call for an Animal Handling check. You also make an Animal Handling check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.

**_Insight._** Your Insight check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.

**_Medicine._** A Medicine check can help you diagnose rare illnesses and diseases, both physical and magical in nature. Swift, once-per-combat: heal an adjacent ally a number of HP equal to your ranks in Medicine.

**_Perception._** Your Perception check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door or spot thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley.

**_Survival._** The GM might ask you to make a Survival check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.

**_Deception._** Your Deception check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, forge a document, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.

**_Intimidation._** When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make an Intimidation check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

**_Performance._** Your Performance check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.

**_Persuasion._** When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Persuasion check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

# Items & Equipment

### Equipment Starting in Play
Characters may start each encounter with any slotted equipment they have in play. For example, a player may start with their armor and weapons.

### Items & Equipment Slots
A player can only have one item in play at a time for each of the following slots: head, body, feet, left hand, and right hand. Weapons and shields specify “One-handed” or “Two-handed”. A player may have two one-handed items (e.g., a sword and a shield) or may have a single two-handed item (e.g., a long-bow). 

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>

### Switching Equipment
If a player has equipment in their hand and already has equipment occupying that slot in play, the player may choose one of the following as a part of playing the new equipment: (a) discard the item in play or (b) return the item in play to the player's hand.

## Tilting & Refreshing 
Some items and equipment have the ability to “tilt”. When you tilt an item you rotate it 90 degrees to show that it’s special ability has been expended. Tilt abilities may only be used once-per-encounter, unless they are “refreshed” by another ability; for example, Second Wind states “Refresh all items you control.”

# Roleplaying
Legendfall is a collaborative game. Players get to know each other's characters and strategize. For example, a player might shout, “Elric, let’s flank the big guy.” As a general rule, each character can communicate 5-10 seconds worth of information to other characters during their turn and a few words as a free action outside their turn (e.g., “Let’s do it!”). Before players take actions they should think about how they can best collaborate and say what they need.

## Metagaming
Part of the fun of Legendfall is getting into character--seeing the world through your characters eyes. Often times there is information that you as a player might know that your character might not--when you leverage that information to gain an advantage, it’s called “Metagaming”. In general, this makes the game less fun. When a player needs help learning the game and understanding the rules, you should absolutely help them. However, you should try to return to your character's perspective after doing so. In general, you should avoid looking at each others cards (e.g., “If you play that, then I can play…”) and collaborating by talking about your strategy as players, instead of characters (e.g., “Stand in this square to be safe when I...”). The game rewards players who get into their characters and think about how their character would think. Do your best to try to stay “in character” as often as you can.
