# Introduction
Legendfall is a strategy tabletop role-playing game about adventuring through a world of legends and villains. It’s about co-creating a universe through the journeys and decisions your characters make. When you open your first Legendfall Origin pack, your character is born.  As a strategy game, players have the ability to craft a unique character, with a unique set of abilities, and tweak and adjust that character as they grow. As a roleplaying game, players walk the journey of a hero in a harsh world filled with corruption and redemption.

# Getting Started
The promise of Legendfall is a game that you can learn by plying rather than requiring a deep knowledge of one or more rulebooks. The game is best started with Encounter 0 (https://www.legendfall.com/encounter-0), this setup encounter will walk you through character creation and bring you into the universe. The first 10 Encounters are designed to give you not only an introduction to the game but also build your map and monster library so that you can create and improvose your own encounters.

# Mastergear
Legendfall is brought to life by giving players special roles. When a player takes on a role, their character holds a piece of equipment known as Mastergear. If you are playing with more than four players, one or more players may not have mastergear, but that’s ok! Roles are not fixed; players can swap Mastergear at the start of each encounter.

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **The Storyteller** - This player is the voice of the narrator, NPCs, and sets the difficulty of any social interaction checks. The most important quality of a Storyteller is a strong/clear voice. The storyteller is a social and charisma focused role, less focused on the rules.                                       | <img src="https://cdn.legendfall.com/cardImages/final/300dpi/mastergear-book-of-the-storyteller.jpg" width="100%" alt="Storyteller Card">                                                                                                 |
| **The Wayfinder** - The Wayfinder controls the environment and sets the difficulty of all checks related to moving and interacting with the world. For example, if a player asks "can I move here" or "is this difficult terrain," the Wayfinder makes the final decision.                                                   | <img src="https://cdn.legendfall.com/cardImages/final/300dpi/mastergear-wayfinder.jpg" width="100%" alt="Wayfinder Card"> |
| **The Beastheart** - Player who holds the Beastheart controls enemies in encounters and ensures encounters are deadly and brilliant. This particular role is best held by a player who has experience with a game like D&D or Magic the Gathering as it requires a deeper understanding of rules, mechanics, and how cards might interact. | <img src="https://cdn.legendfall.com/cardImages/final/300dpi/mastergear-beastheart.jpg" width="100%" alt="Beastheart Card">                                                                                                 |
| **The Titanback** - The Titanback is the quartermaster and tactician for the team, they manage any treasure, XP, equipment, and manage a variety of party resources and needs. This role belongs to your most organized player, the kind of person who takes notes and likes to put everything in its right place.                  | <img src="https://cdn.legendfall.com/cardImages/final/300dpi/mastergear-titanback.jpg" width="100%" alt="Titanback Card">                                                                                                 |

# Character Creation & Setup

Each player turns their deck face up, revealing their Ancestry card. Each player takes turns revealing who they are (e.g., “I’m a Mettlebound”).

Set the Ancestry card in front of you and reveal the next two cards on top of the deck in the same way. These are your Background and Trait cards. Collectively these three cards are called your Roots.

Next, have everyone look in their deck for their Character Card, it has a space for your character’s name and bubbles to fill in. Set this card next to your roots.

Your Roots have small colored symbols in the bottom right corner. Look for the matching symbols on your character Character Card. For each matching symbol, fill in one bubble on your Character Card. These are called Skill Ranks. **You will fill in a total of four bubbles.** Ignore the white circle with the number in it. You’ll find a Sharpie in the box labeled “Dice”.

In the example images, you can see that being a Leyfal grants you a skill rank in Wild and Sense.

<img src="https://cdn.legendfall.com/website/example-starters-skill-card.jpg" width="50%" alt="Skill Card Example">  

## Pick Your Token & Name Your Character
Look in your stack of cards for a thick card with six character portraits, choose the one you like the most and pop it out. This is you! Show it to the other players so they know what you look like. Set the other tokens aside, you won’t need them. Now that you know what you look like, give your character a name. Be creative. Choose something that sounds epic and heroic to you.

## Setting Up Your Play Area
There are just a few cards that start “in play” (face up in front of you).

* Remove the two instruction cards from your deck and set them aside for reference.
* Your Character Card and your Ancestry card start in play, you should already have them in front of you; your other two Roots cards are put back into your deck, face down.
Weapon and Armor cards start the game in play. Everyone starts with two weapons: one for close combat (melee), and another for long-distance combat (ranged). Put the Ravenhand Glove equipment card underneath your Ancestry Card; the Ravenhand won’t be used in this first encounter.
* All other cards are placed face-down in your deck. Your deck should have ten cards. Shuffle it.
* Each player needs two twenty-sided dice (d20). 
  * Choose one die to be your health (HP)—all players start with 10 HP. Set the die to 10. 
  * The other die will be used to roll your attacks and abilities.

* Each player should have two six-sided dice; these will be used to count things like the number of times you have used your Ancestry card.
Your play area should look like the image below:
![Play Area Setup](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6490ff456dbdd067ee3af25a/78f46b68-5116-4a2e-a154-a5c563a2fbc9/example-setup.jpg)

## Your First Encounter
Put your Weapons, Armor, and Ancestry cards face up on the table (“in play”). The rest of the cards are your deck; they start face down. You will draw from these each turn.


### Your First Turn
Not sure what to do your first turn? Moving and attacking an enemy is a great place to start:

1. Look at your armor to see how many squares you can move. Move towards an enemy counting your squares of movement. Moving in any direction (including diagonal) counts as one square of movement.
2. Choose one of your weapons and attack by following the rules on the card. Legendfall is played almost exclusively with 20 sided dice, henceforth referred to as a d20. Weapon attacks always require you to roll a d20. When you see a label like "10+" this means to follow the directions on the card if you rolled a 10 or higher. Your attack will always hit unless something is done in response to prevent it.
3. At the end of your turn, draw 1 card from your deck. Say "I'm drawing my card" or "Pass turn" to signal it is the next players turn.
<br>

### Defending Against Attacks
When you're under attack, your armor comes in handy. Read your armor card. If there is a Defense value, reduce damage dealt to you by that amount. A character only has one defense at any given time. If an ability grants you a higher defense than your current defense, defer to the highest value. You can't wear more than one set of armor.

### Role-playing
Legendfall is a collaborative role-playing game. Do your best to think from your characters perspective as you fight alongside your party. A player might shout, “Lerik, let’s get the big guy together.” If someone jumps in to help you, say thank you and remember to use their character name. Talking "in character" takes time to learn. You don't have to talk using your characters voice in order to roleplay; you can describe what your character is feeling and doing: "Kirin looks with vengeful eyes at the big wolf who just took a bite out of Lerik."

### Your Next Turns
In addition to moving a number of squares equal to the "Move" value on your armor, you can take three other actions in a round: one **standard action** (e.g., use your weapon), one **swift action**, and one **immediate action**. Immediate actions can be used anytime, even during your opponents turn; you can say: “Before that happens, I use an immediate action.” (A deeper exploration can be found in Actions, page 3).

The vast majority of the rules in Legendfall are baked into each characters cards. If your confused or unsure at anytime about what something means, ask your GM.

On your next turns, here are a few things to try: 

* Use an ability card you drew from your deck. Pay attention to what type of action it uses (e.g., standard, swift, or immediate). Remember, you get one of each action each turn. Most ability cards are put in your discard pile after being used. 
* Move. Attack. And move again. Sometimes the best way to stay safe is to attack and then move somewhere safe.
* Team up with an ally and fight side by side or back to back (it's the safest way to fight).
* Try to use an immediate action during an ally or enemie's turn. Try to think of a moment when you can say, ”Before that happens, I...”

Your limit of one standard, swift, and immediate action resets at the beginning of your turn. If you've used all your actions, you'll need to wait a full round for them to reset.

### When you Run Out of Cards
When you run out of cards, your character is exhausted. You can still fight, but won't have any cards to draw.

### Resting After the Encounter

Everything stays in play when the encounter ends, the battle might continue. To get your cards back your party needs to rest for 1 hour. When you do, shuffle all cards into your deck and reset any counters on your cards.



# Leveling Up
Leveling up is about growing your character, gaining new abilities, and becoming a better teammate. Each time you gain a level, follow the rules on the Leveling Up card included in your origin pack. 

## Class Training
When you reach 1st level, you will choose your first class. You can begin multi-classing at 3rd Level:
- **Rogue** - Melee-focused, you make big strikes and then fade into the shadows, sacrificing your lifeforce to do so. You are vengeance incarnate.
- **Warden** - Ranged-focused, with powerful ranged weapon strikes, nature magic, healing, and animal companions. You were chosen by the wild to fight.
- **Vitalist** - Melee-focused, hand and foot strike your enemies and heal allies all in a single stride. You strive to bring balance to all things.
- **Mage** - Ranged-magic focused, bending the rules of reality, controlling minds, and channeling multi-enemy blasts. Your calling is power.
- **Marshal** - Melee-focused, you are the center of combat, through taunts and defence you live to keep others alive. You're a rebel who leads from the front.

## Adding Ranks to Skills
When you reach 1st level, you will begin adding ranks into your class skills. When you do this, you must choose three different skills and add one rank to each--do not add multiple ranks to the same skill.

## HP & Max Build
As you gain levels and explore the world you'll discover powerful talents and abilities. Build points measure your characters power, balancing it along with your allies. Look in the bottom right corner of your cards and you'll see a number in a white circle, this is the cost of your card in build points. Count the build points on all your cards, they may not exceed your current HP / Build Point Max for your level.


| Level  | XP Cost | GAINED                             | HP & MAX BUILD |
|--------|---------|------------------------------------|----------------|
| Origin | 0       | Origin Pack                        | 10             |
| 1st    | 300     | Class Training, add one rank to three skills | 10 |
| 2nd    | 400     | Draw 2 first round                 | 12             |
| 3rd    | 600     | Class Training, add one rank to three skills | 14 |
| 4th    | 700     | Draw 3 first round                 | 14             |
| 5th    | 800     | Class Training, add one rank to three skills | 15 |
| 6th    | 800     | 1 Accessory starts in Play         | 16             |
| 7th    | 1000    | Class Training, add one rank to three skills | 17 |
| 8th    | 1000    | 2 Accessories start in Play        | 18             |
| 9th    | 1000    | Class Training, add one rank to three skills | 19 |
| 10th   | 1500    | Draw 4 first round                 | 20             |


# Actions

As you begin to become more serious about Legendfall, the ability to optimzie your actions each turn becomes increasingly important. This section aims to take you a layer deepr into the nuances of each of the action types and how they work in a variety of situations. Don't feel overwhelmed as you read this section, many of these rules are advanced and will be brought up by your GM exclusively when their needed later in the game.

## Action Types

* **Standard Actions** - Each character may take one standard action during their turn. If a player doesn't have a standard action card in their hand, they can make a standard attack with one of their weapons. A player may always sacrifice their standard action in exchange for an additional move, swift, or immediate action.

* **Move Actions** - Each character may move during their turn. Typically a player may move a number of squares (including diagonals) as is marked on their armor. A character wearing no armor may move up to 7 squares during their turn. Characters may move through allies squares as if that ally we’re not there, but they may not move through enemy squares. A player may not end their turn standing in a square shared by an enemy or allie. Moving through water or climbing costs additional movement. (See Difficult Terrain, page 5). A player can take other actions in the middle of their movement. For example, move 3 squares, use a standard action to heal an ally, and move another 4 squares.

* **Swift Actions** - Each character may take one swift action during their turn. These are typically quick support abilities.

* **Immediate Actions** - Each character may take one immediate action per-round during another player or enemies turn. These are often disruptive or life-saving abilities. A player may choose to use their immediate action during their own turn if they so choose. Like all other actions, once a player has used their immediate action for the round, it is refreshed at the beginning of their turn.

* **Free Actions** - Players may take an unlimited number of free actions.

## Attacking
In Legendfall all attacks are assumed to hit unless the character you are attacking does something (e.g., uses an ability) or there are circumstances in the combat that might cause a player to miss (e.g., a dense fog covers the battlefield, you must roll high to hit). Attacks follow a simple pattern:

1. **Choose a target and announce your attack.** Pick an enemy within the reach of your attack. Melee attacks typically require you to be adjacent to the enemy. Ranged attacks specify their range on the card.
2. **Roll attack dice.** Roll damage dice as described in the attack.
3. **Pause for reactions** Many immediate actions can manipulate or even prevent damage after it has been rolled.
4. **Resolve damage and defence.** Subtract defence from the attack damage and apply any other effects.

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>

> * Zoe: “I’m attacking the dark knight who just hurt Dina, I’ll use my short sword.”
> * Dina: “That guy is going down! Before Zoe attacks I use an immediate action to summon a Giant Bird behind the dark knight--this gives Zoe an additional 1 damage on her attack.”
> * Zoe: “By the might of the eagle I banish thee! I rolled a 6, plus one for the eagle--that’s 7 damage. Woot!”
> * GM: “The dark knight is dealt a fearsome blow, his armor soaks 3 of your damage, but he takes 4 and falls to his knees blood gushing from his neck--he’s dead.”

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>

### Weapons & Ability Cards
Players with weapons in play may always take a standard action to use their weapon. Many standard actions in your deck will include phrases like this “Weapon damage +1”. This means that your ability is executed using your weapon. In these circumstances, you should follow the rules of both your weapon card and the card you are playing.

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>

>* Zoe: “I’m going to use my Sneak Attack on the goblin, attacking with my short sword”
> * GM: “Go for it."
>* Zoe: “Sneak Attack lets me deal Weapon Damage + 2. My shortsword deals 1d6 damage and an additional 2 damage if I roll a 1. I just rolled a 1. So my weapon deals 3 damage and I get an extra plus two for my sneak attack. Hey, that's 5 damage--not bad!”

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>

### Responding to Attacks
If an immediate action is used that makes an attack miss or otherwise impossible (e.g, the target is no longer in line of site), the attack automatically fails including any secondary effects against that target. If a player or enemy is killed in the middle of an attack, even if damage dice had already been rolled, damage and any other secondary effects are canceled.



## Movement & Terrain
A player may move a number of squares as is marked on their armor. A character wearing no armor may move up to 7 squares. There are a few basic rules for how players move:

* A character may use a standard action to double their movement for the round
* Characters may not move through enemy squares
* Characters may move through allies squares
* Players may not end their turn in the same square with an ally or enemy 
* Moving both horizontally and diagnally costs 1 movement.

### Move, Action, Move
Players may take other actions between using their movement for the round. For example, a player might move to attack, then move around a corner to hide. Player or enemy movement may be interrupted mid-move by immediate actions. When this occurs, the remainder of that player or enemy movement may be spent after the effect is resolved. 

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>

> * GM: “The wolves move forward to attack you”
> * Zoe: “When they reach this spot, I cast Ice Wall as an immediate action to block them.”
> * GM: “The wolves are startled as huge sheets of ice slide up blocking their path, they howl and begin to circle around the ice blocks to find you, but you are too far away to attack.”

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>

### Pushing & Pulling
Many abilities specify effects like "Push 1" or "Pull 2". These effects allow you to force an enemy (or an allie) to move. The number represents the number of squares of movement they are pushed or pulled.

**Push** - A push effect must always move the target away from the source of the effect. At each step of the movement, the target must be one square further away from you--e.g., you can’t push an adjacent enemy into a different adjacent square.

**Pull** - A pull effect must always move the target towards the source of the effect. At each step of the movement, the target must be one square closer--e.g., you can’t pull an adjacent enemy into a different adjacent square.

If a character is pushed or pulled through or into a Hazard, resolve that Hazzard immediately as they enter the square.

### Hazards
Hazards represent traps, fire, lava, or any other danger within the environment that a payer or enemy might find themselves moving into or through. When Hazards are triggered, this typically results in damage to the player. Hazards are triggered in two ways:

* When a player moves into a Hazard square
* When a player ends their turn in an ongoing Hazard square (e.g., lava)

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>

### Difficult Terrain
Boulders, mud, ice, are just a few of the types of difficult terrain that may slow down players. Moving into a difficult terrain square costs no additional movement, while moving through or leaving difficult terrain costs one additional movement. For example, climbing into a river would be a normal single square of movement, wading through he water would cost two squares, and then climbing out would cost two squares for a total of five squares of movement. 

#### Swimming
Swimming follows the standard rules for difficult terrain costing one movement to enter the water, and two movement to move through or exit the water.

#### Climbing
If a character is attempting to climb, imagine if the wall itself is a square of difficult terrain. It takes one square of movement to move into this vertical square, and two squares of movement to move out of this square up on top of the wall. A player must end their turn standing flat on the surface they intend to climb or they fall.

### Falling
If a character is standing on elevated terrain and falls more than one square, they take 1d6 damage, ignoring defense, for each square they fall beyond the first. For example, a character falling from three blocks up would take 2d6 damage. A player may roll an Athetlics or Acrobatics skill check to negate this damage (10 or higher negates 1d6, 15 or higher negates 2d6).

## Line of Sight and Cover
Obstacles on the battlefield have a direct impact on your ability to target and hit enemies. Both players and enemies can “take cover” to avoid attacks and reduce the likelihood of taking damage. 

### Line of Sight
In order to target an enemy with an attack, you require a line of sight. If there is a wall directly between you and an enemy, you can’t see them, and thus can not target them with attacks. In times where it is more ambiguous whether you have a line of sight, there are some simple rules to help. As the attacker, choose a single corner of your square. If you can draw a line from that corner to at least two corners of your opponent's square without passing through a solid object, you have a line of sight. Enemies and allies between you do not block line of sight.

### Cover
When you or an enemy is partially blocked by an object, another enemy, or an ally, you have a chance of missing your target and hitting something else. When you attack an enemy, choose a corner of your square. If you can draw straight lines to at least three different corners of the enemies square without passing through an object, enemy, or allie then you have a clear shot. If you can only draw two lines, you have a 50% miss chance. If you miss, proceed as if your attack was targeting whatever object, enemy or ally caused you to miss.

For those familiar with the pen and paper role-playing terms “half-cover” and “three-quarters cover”, you can translate as follows: there is no penalty for half-cover and there is a 50% miss chance for three-quarters cover.


# Abilities 2.0
Skills often times represent the techniques your character will use to solve problems or get themselevs out of whatever sticky binds you find youself in.

## Strength

**_Strength_** Your Brute check covers situations in which brute force is required. For example, force open a stuck, locked, or barred door, break free of bonds, push through a tunnel that is too small, hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it, tip over a statue, keep a boulder from rolling

**_Athletics._** Your Athletics check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. For example, climbing a slippery cliff, clinging to a wall when someone is trying to knock you off, jumping an unusually long distance, swimming in treacherous waters or staying afloat when being pulled down.

## Grit

## Dexterity

**_Deception._** Your Deception check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, forge a document, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.

**_Stealth._** Make a Stealth check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the Perception check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.

# Items & Equipment

### Equipment Starting in Play
Characters may start each encounter with any slotted equipment they have in play. For example, a player may start with their armor and weapons.

### Items & Equipment Slots
A player can only have one item in play at a time for each of the following slots: head, body, feet, left hand, and right hand. Weapons and shields specify “One-handed” or “Two-handed”. A player may have two one-handed items (e.g., a sword and a shield) or may have a single two-handed item (e.g., a long-bow). 

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>

### Switching Equipment
If a player has equipment in their hand and already has equipment occupying that slot in play, the player may choose one of the following as a part of playing the new equipment: (a) discard the item in play or (b) return the item in play to the player's hand.

## Tilting & Refreshing 
Some items and equipment have the ability to “tilt”. When you tilt an item you rotate it 90 degrees to show that it’s special ability has been expended. Tilt abilities may only be used once-per-encounter, unless they are “refreshed” by another ability; for example, Second Wind states “Refresh all items you control.”

# Roleplaying
Legendfall is a collaborative game. Players get to know each other's characters and strategize. For example, a player might shout, “Elric, let’s flank the big guy.” As a general rule, each character can communicate 5-10 seconds worth of information to other characters during their turn and a few words as a free action outside their turn (e.g., “Let’s do it!”). Before players take actions they should think about how they can best collaborate and say what they need.

## Metagaming
Part of the fun of Legendfall is getting into character--seeing the world through your characters eyes. Often times there is information that you as a player might know that your character might not--when you leverage that information to gain an advantage, it’s called “Metagaming”. In general, this makes the game less fun. When a player needs help learning the game and understanding the rules, you should absolutely help them. However, you should try to return to your character's perspective after doing so. In general, you should avoid looking at each others cards (e.g., “If you play that, then I can play…”) and collaborating by talking about your strategy as players, instead of characters (e.g., “Stand in this square to be safe when I...”). The game rewards players who get into their characters and think about how their character would think. Do your best to try to stay “in character” as often as you can.
