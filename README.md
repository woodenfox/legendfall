# Introduction
Legendfall is a strategy tabletop role-playing game about adventuring through a world of legends and villains. It’s about co-creating a universe through the journeys and decisions your characters make. When you open your first Legendfall Origin pack, your character is born: you could be an altruistic elven swashbuckler, an impulsive dwarven gladiator, an empathic halfling smuggler and many more--there are over 21,000 starting character combinations. As a strategy game, players have the ability to craft a unique character, with a unique set of abilities, and tweak and adjust that character as they grow. As a roleplaying game, players walk the journey of a hero in a harsh world filled with corruption and redemption.

# Getting Started
The promise of Legendfall is a game that you can learn by plying rather than requiring a deep knowledge of one or more rulebooks. The game is best started with Encounter 0 (https://www.legendfall.com/encounter-0), this setup encounter will walk you through character creation and bring you into the universe. The first 10 Encounters are designed to give you not only an introduction to the game but also build your map and monster library so that you can create and improvose your own encounters.

# Mastergear
Legendfall is brought to life by giving players special roles. When a player takes on a role, their character holds a piece of equipment known as Mastergear. If you are playing with more than four players, one or more players may not have mastergear, but that’s ok! Roles are not fixed; players can swap Mastergear at the start of each encounter.
| Role + Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Image                                                                                               |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **The Storyteller** - This player is the voice of the narrator, NPCs, and sets the difficulty of any social interaction checks. The most important quality of a Storyteller is a strong/clear voice. The storyteller is a social and charisma focused role, less focused on the rules.                                       | <img src="https://cdn.legendfall.com/cardImages/final/300dpi/mastergear-book-of-the-storyteller.jpg" width="100%" alt="Storyteller Card">                                                                                                 |
| **The Wayfinder** - The Wayfinder controls the environment and sets the difficulty of all checks related to moving and interacting with the world. For example, if a player asks "can I move here" or "is this difficult terrain," the Wayfinder makes the final decision.                                                   | <img src="https://cdn.legendfall.com/cardImages/final/300dpi/mastergear-wayfinder.jpg" width="100%" alt="Wayfinder Card"> |
| **The Beastheart** - Player who holds the Beastheart controls enemies in encounters and ensures encounters are deadly and brilliant. This particular role is best held by a player who has experience with a game like D&D or Magic the Gathering as it requires a deeper understanding of rules, mechanics, and how cards might interact. | <img src="https://cdn.legendfall.com/cardImages/final/300dpi/mastergear-beastheart.jpg" width="100%" alt="Beastheart Card">                                                                                                 |
| **The Titanback** - The Titanback is the quartermaster and tactician for the team, they manage any treasure, XP, equipment, and manage a variety of party resources and needs. This role belongs to your most organized player, the kind of person who takes notes and likes to put everything in its right place.                  | <img src="https://cdn.legendfall.com/cardImages/final/300dpi/mastergear-titanback.jpg" width="100%" alt="Titanback Card">                                                                                                 |

# Character Creation & Setup
Character creation in Legendfall is very simple. Open an Origin pack and you have a fully ready to play character. Each Orgin pack includes 18 unique cards. :

* 1x Ancestry Card*
* 1x Trait Card*
* 1x Background Card*
* 1x Character Card (A.k.a., Skill Card)
* 2x Instruction Cards
* 1x Ranged Weapon Card
* 1x Melee Weapon Card
* 1x Armor Card
* 6x Basic Skill Cards
* 1x Second Wind
* 1x Inspire
* 1x Ravenshand

## Your Starting Skills
Your Ancestry, Trait, and Background Cards are known as your "Roots". Look in the bottom right corner of these cards for symbols. You'll find matching symbols on your Character Card. For each matching symbol, fill in one bubble on your Character Card. These are called Skill Ranks. **You will fill in a total of four bubbles.** For now, you should ignore the white circle with a number in it.

<img src="https://cdn.legendfall.com/website/example-starters-skill-card.jpg" width="50%" alt="Skill Card Example">  

## Pick Your Token & Name Your Character
Look in your stack of cards for a thick card with six character portraits, choose the one you like the most and pop it out. This is you! Show it to the other players so they know what you look like. Set the other tokens aside, you won’t need them. Now that you know what you look like, give your character a name. Be creative. Choose something that sounds epic and heroic to you.

## Setting Up Your Play Area
There are just a few cards that start “in play” (face up in front of you).

* Remove the two instruction cards from your deck and set them aside for reference.
* Your Character Card and your Ancestry card start in play, you should already have them in front of you; your other two Roots cards are put back into your deck, face down.
Weapon and Armor cards start the game in play. Everyone starts with two weapons: one for close combat (melee), and another for long-distance combat (ranged). Put the Ravenhand Glove equipment card underneath your Ancestry Card; the Ravenhand won’t be used in this first encounter.
* All other cards are placed face-down in your deck. Your deck should have ten cards. Shuffle it.
* Each player needs two twenty-sided dice (d20). 
  * Choose one die to be your health (HP)—all players start with 10 HP. Set the die to 10. 
  * The other die will be used to roll your attacks and abilities.

* Each player should have two six-sided dice; these will be used to count things like the number of times you have used your Ancestry card.
Your play area should look like the image below:

# Your First Encounter
Legendfall is designed to be easy to learn and progressive, in the same way that the basics of chess can be learned in just a few minutes, new players in Legendfall can make a meaninful impact just by knowing a few basic rules. Over time, you'll learn better and more strategic ways to play that leverage the unique strengths of your character.

## Your First Turn
Let's get started with the basics: moving and attacking.

### Moving
Look at your armor to see how many squares you can move, in the very middle of the card you should see something like “Move 6”, you can move in any direction including diagonal (there is no difference in movement cost). Use your movement to move towards an enemy. You can use any remaining movement to move away form an enemy after you attack.

### Attacking
Choose one of your weapons and attack by following the rules on the card. Legendfall is played almost exclusively with 20 sided dice, henceforth referred to as a d20. Weapon attacks always require you to roll a d20. When you see a label like "10+" this means to follow the directions on the card if you rolled a 10 or higher. Your attack will always hit unless something is done in response to prevent it.
<img src="https://cdn.legendfall.com/cardImages/final/300dpi/equipment-meq-shortsword.jpg" width="50%" alt="Shortsword"> 

### Ending Your Turn
When you’ve completed your turn say “Pass Turn” and then draw one card. Keep this drawn card in your hand. If you are lucky you might draw an Immediate action. These cards may be used during ally and enemy turns. You may interrupt others’ actions by saying something like: “Before they move..” or “Before that 6 damage is dealt”.

## Defending Against Attacks
Players have a few ways to deal with incoming damage. First, if your armor has a defense value (e.g., Defence 1) then  subtract that amount of damage from a hit. Second, every player has an equipment card that can be used “once” to prevent the damage of a single attack. This is a Free Immediate action, what that means is that it can be used even if the player has already used an Immediate Action this turn.

## Your Next Turns
In addition to moving a number of squares equal to the "Move" value on your armor, you can take other actions every turn:

* You may take one **standard action** (e.g., use your weapon)
* You may take one **swift action**--check your Ancestry card to see if you have a swift action. If you do, try to use it every turn.
* You may take one **immediate action**. Immediate actions can be used anytime, even during your opponents turn; you can say: “Before that happens, I use an immediate action.” (A deeper exploration can be found in Actions, page 3).
* You may take unlimited "free" actions. If an action is labled as free, it dosn't count against your limit for the round.

The vast majority of the rules in Legendfall are baked into each characters cards. If your not sure how a card words, ask the other players. If you're really stumped on a card ruling, put it to a vote.

On your next turns, here are a few things to try: 

* Use an ability card you drew from your deck. Pay attention to what type of action it uses (e.g., standard, swift, or immediate). Remember, you get one of each action each turn. Most ability cards are put in your discard pile after being used. 
* Move. Attack. And move again. Sometimes the best way to stay safe is to attack and then move somewhere safe.
* Team up with an ally and fight side by side or back to back (it's the safest way to fight).
* Try to use an immediate action during an ally or enemie's turn. Try to think of a moment when you can say, ”Before that happens, I...”

Your limit of one standard, swift, and immediate action resets at the beginning of your turn. If you've used all your actions, you'll need to wait a full round for them to reset.

## When you Run Out of Cards
When you run out of cards, your character is exhausted. You can still fight, but won't have any cards to draw.

## Resting After the Encounter
Everything stays in play when the encounter ends, the battle might continue. To get your cards back your party needs to rest for 1 hour. When you do, shuffle all cards into your deck and reset any counters on your cards.

## Role-playing
Legendfall is a collaborative role-playing game. Do your best to think from your characters perspective as you fight alongside your party. A player might shout, “Lerik, let’s get the big guy together.” If someone jumps in to help you, say thank you and remember to use their character name. Talking "in character" takes time to learn. You don't have to talk using your characters voice in order to roleplay; you can describe what your character is feeling and doing: "Kirin looks with vengeful eyes at the big wolf who just took a bite out of Lerik."

# Leveling Up
Leveling up is about growing your character, gaining new abilities, and becoming a better teammate. Each time you gain a level, follow the rules on the Leveling Up card included in your origin pack. 

## Class Training
When you reach 1st level, you will choose your first class. You can begin multi-classing at 3rd Level:
- **Rogue** - Melee-focused, you make big strikes and then fade into the shadows, sacrificing your lifeforce to do so. You are vengeance incarnate.
- **Warden** - Ranged-focused, with powerful ranged weapon strikes, nature magic, healing, and animal companions. You were chosen by the wild to fight.
- **Vitalist** - Melee-focused, hand and foot strike your enemies and heal allies all in a single stride. You strive to bring balance to all things.
- **Mage** - Ranged-magic focused, bending the rules of reality, controlling minds, and channeling multi-enemy blasts. Your calling is power.
- **Marshal** - Melee-focused, you are the center of combat, through taunts and defence you live to keep others alive. You're a rebel who leads from the front.

## Adding Ranks to Skills
When you reach 1st level, you will begin adding ranks into your class skills. When you do this, you must choose three different skills and add one rank to each--do not add multiple ranks to the same skill.

## HP & Max Build
As you gain levels and explore the world you'll discover powerful talents and abilities. Build points measure your characters power, balancing it along with your allies. Look in the bottom right corner of your cards and you'll see a number in a white circle, this is the cost of your card in build points. Count the build points on all your cards, they may not exceed your current HP / Build Point Max for your level.


| Level  | XP Cost | GAINED                             | HP & MAX BUILD |
|--------|---------|------------------------------------|----------------|
| Origin | 0       | Origin Pack                        | 10             |
| 1st    | 300     | Class Training, add one rank to three skills | 10 |
| 2nd    | 400     | Draw 2 first round                 | 12             |
| 3rd    | 600     | Class Training, add one rank to three skills | 14 |
| 4th    | 700     | Draw 3 first round                 | 14             |
| 5th    | 800     | Class Training, add one rank to three skills | 15 |
| 6th    | 800     | 1 Accessory starts in Play         | 16             |

| 10th   | 1500    | Draw 4 first round                 | 20             |

![black ink, page section break, white background --ar 5:1 --v 6.0](https://github.com/woodenfox/legendfall/assets/4211419/cdfa4471-4b89-480e-a59b-ecd76e8eb37d)

# Actions

As you begin to become more serious about Legendfall, the ability to optimize your actions each turn becomes increasingly important. This section aims to take you a layer deeper into the nuances of each of the action types and how they work in a variety of situations. Don't feel overwhelmed as you read this section, many of these rules only apply as you work to make your character the best they can be, you can be impactful and effective even just making basic attacks each round.

## Action Types

* **Standard Actions** - Each character may take one standard action during their turn. If a player doesn't have a standard action card in their hand, they can make a standard attack with one of their weapons. A player may always sacrifice their standard action in exchange for an additional move, swift, or immediate action.

* **Move Actions** - Each character may move during their turn. Typically a player may move a number of squares (including diagonals) as is marked on their armor. A character wearing no armor may move up to 7 squares during their turn. Characters may move through allies squares as if that ally we’re not there, but they may not move through enemy squares. A player may not end their turn standing in a square shared by an enemy or allie. Moving through water or climbing costs additional movement. (See Difficult Terrain, page 5). A player can take other actions in the middle of their movement. For example, move 3 squares, use a standard action to heal an ally, and move another 4 squares.

* **Swift Actions** - Each character may take one swift action during their turn. These are typically quick support abilities.

* **Immediate Actions** - Each character may take one immediate action per-round during another player or enemies turn. These are often disruptive or life-saving abilities. A player may choose to use their immediate action during their own turn if they so choose. Like all other actions, once a player has used their immediate action for the round, it is refreshed at the beginning of their turn.

* **Free Actions** - Players may take an unlimited number of free actions.

## Attacking
In Legendfall all attacks are assumed to hit unless the character you are attacking does something (e.g., uses an ability) or there are circumstances in the combat that might cause a player to miss (e.g., a dense fog covers the battlefield, you must roll high to hit). Attacks follow a simple pattern:

1. **Choose a target and announce your attack.** Pick an enemy within the reach of your attack. Melee attacks typically require you to be adjacent to the enemy. Ranged attacks specify their range on the card.
2. **Roll attack dice.** Roll damage dice as described in the attack.
3. **Pause for reactions** Many immediate actions can manipulate or even prevent damage after it has been rolled.
4. **Resolve damage and defence.** Subtract defence from the attack damage and apply any other effects.

> * Zoe: “I’m attacking the dark knight who just hurt Dina, I’ll use my shortsword.”
> * Dina: “That guy is going down! Before Zoe attacks I use an immediate action to summon a Giant Bird behind the dark knight--this gives Zoe an additional 1 damage on her attack.”
> * Zoe: “By the might of the eagle I banish thee! I rolled a 12, thats 6 damage plus one for the eagle--that’s 7 damage. Woot!”
> * Beastheart: “The dark knight is dealt a fearsome blow, his armor soaks 3 of your damage, but he takes 4 and falls to his knees blood gushing from his neck--he’s dead.”

### Weapons & Ability Cards
Players with weapons in play may always take a standard action to use their weapon. Many standard actions in your deck will include phrases like this “Weapon damage +1”. This means that your ability is executed using your weapon. In these circumstances, you should follow the rules of both your weapon card and the card you are playing.

> * Zoe: “I’m going to use my Sneak Attack on the goblin, attacking with my short sword”
> * Beastheart: “Go for it."
> * Zoe: “Sneak Attack lets me make a weapon attack with bonus damage equal to my cunning. I rolled a 3 on my attack so my dagger only deals 1 damage, ignoring defence. With my 3 ranks in cunning that is still 4 damage. Not bad!”

### Refocusing & Responses to Attacks
If you are attacking and an enemy takes an action that would make your attack impossible (e.g., jumps back out of range or line of sight), your attack fails. You may, however use an immediate action to avoid loosing your standard action for the round, this is called Refocusing. After Refocusing, an attacker may choose to use any remaining movement they have and try again.

> * Katra: "I just rolled a 20, thats 8 damage agains the Ice Toad, take it buddy!"
> * Beastmaster: "As you begin to swing, the Void Toad takes an immediate action to leap back 3 squares over the river."
> * Katra: "Darn it, I don't want to loose my standard action for the round, I'll use my immediate to refocus. I'm out of movement, but I'll use my swift action Hurdle to close the gap. You're not getting away from me. I'll make another attack."

### What Happens When an Immediate Action Defeats an Enemey
If an immediate action is used in response to an enemy attack and the enemy is defeated as a part of that attack (e.g., Second Wind), the enemies attack, damage, and any related effects are prevented. Immediate actions can be used in response to an enemy even after damage has been announced.

> * Beastmaster: "The Klikrog lands a fearsom blow on you for 9 damage."
> * Garrick: "Before he can complete his strike, I come up from uderneith using Second Wind to make a weapon attack. I rolled an 18, thats 6 damage. Is that enough to kill him?"
> * Beastmaster: "Just as he was about to strike a home run with your head you duck to the side and drive a spear into his chest, he's dead."

# Movement & Terrain
Teh Wayfinder is the master of movment, in any situation where there is ambiguity around the map or terrain, defer to the Wayfinder. Players movement is set based on their armor. A character wearing no armor may move up to 7 squares. There are a few basic rules for how players move:

* A character may use a standard action to double their movement for the round
* Characters may not move through enemy squares
* Characters may move through allies squares
* Players may not end their turn in the same square with an ally or enemy 
* Moving both horizontally and diagnally costs 1 movement.

## Move, Action, Move
Players may take other actions between using their movement for the round. For example, a player might move to attack, then move around a corner to hide. Player or enemy movement may be interrupted mid-move by immediate actions. When this occurs, the remainder of that player or enemy movement may be spent after the effect is resolved. 

> * GM: “The wolves move forward to attack you”
> * Zoe: “When they reach this spot, I cast Ice Wall as an immediate action to block them.”
> * GM: “The wolves are startled as huge sheets of ice slide up blocking their path, they howl and begin to circle around the ice blocks to find you, but you are too far away to attack.”

## Pushing & Pulling
Many abilities specify effects like "Push 1" or "Pull 2". These effects allow you to force an enemy (or an allie) to move. The number represents the number of squares of movement they are pushed or pulled.

**Push** - A push effect must always move the target away from the source of the effect. At each step of the movement, the target must be one square further away from you--e.g., you can’t push an adjacent enemy into a different adjacent square.
**Pull** - A pull effect must always move the target towards the source of the effect. At each step of the movement, the target must be one square closer--e.g., you can’t pull an adjacent enemy into a different adjacent square.

If a character is pushed or pulled through or into a Hazard, resolve that Hazzard immediately as they enter the square.

## Hazards
Hazards represent traps, fire, lava, or any other danger within the environment that a payer or enemy might find themselves moving into or through. When Hazards are triggered, this typically results in damage to the player. Hazards are triggered in two ways:

* When a player moves into a Hazard square
* When a player ends their turn in an ongoing Hazard square (e.g., lava)

## Difficult Terrain
Boulders, mud, ice, are just a few of the types of difficult terrain that may slow down players. Moving into a difficult terrain square costs no additional movement, while moving through or leaving difficult terrain costs one additional movement. For example, climbing into a river would be a normal single square of movement, wading through he water would cost two squares, and then climbing out would cost two squares for a total of five squares of movement. 

### Swimming
Swimming follows the standard rules for difficult terrain costing one movement to enter the water, and two movement to move through or exit the water.

### Climbing & Falling
The rules effects for Climbing and Falling depend on the encounter you are playing. See the encounter rules or defer to the Wayfinder for clarity.

## Line of Sight and Cover
Obstacles on the battlefield have a direct impact on your ability to target and hit enemies. Both players and enemies can “take cover” to avoid attacks and reduce the likelihood of taking damage. 

### Line of Sight
In order to target an enemy with an attack, you require a line of sight. If there is a wall directly between you and an enemy, you can’t see them, and thus can not target them with attacks. In times where it is more ambiguous whether you have a line of sight, there are some simple rules to help. As the attacker, choose a single corner of your square. If you can draw a line from that corner to at least two corners of your opponent's square without passing through a solid object, you have a line of sight. Enemies and allies between you do not block line of sight.

### Cover
When you or an enemy is partially blocked by an object, another enemy, or an ally, you have a chance of missing your target and hitting something else. When you attack an enemy, choose a corner of your square. If you can draw straight lines to at least three different corners of the enemies square without passing through an object, enemy, or allie then you have a clear shot. If you can only draw two lines, you have a 50% miss chance. If you miss, proceed as if your attack was targeting whatever object, enemy or ally caused you to miss.

For those familiar with the pen and paper role-playing terms “half-cover” and “three-quarters cover”, you can translate as follows: there is no penalty for half-cover and there is a 50% miss chance for three-quarters cover.

# Skills 
Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by skills. This section explains in more detail what those skills are and the ways they are used in the game. These skills are reproduced under the OGL, with minor modifications. Each skill has a rank (from 0 to 5) which determines how trained a character is that particular skill.

- **Sense**:  This skill represents a character's heightened awareness and perception. Characters with high Sense can detect hidden traps, notice subtle clues, and perceive incoming threats more effectively than others.
- **Current**: This skill reflects a character's deep understanding and mastery of arcane knowledge and mystical forces. Characters with a high Current skill are adept at identifying and interpreting magical phenomena, casting complex spells, and deciphering ancient magical texts.

## Testing skills
To test a skill, the player rolls a number of ten-sided dice (D10) equal to their skill rank plus one. A roll is successful if the die shows a 6 or higher. 
The difficulty levels for tests are: 
* Easy (1 success needed)
* Medium (2 successes)
* Hard (3 successes)
* Very hard (4 successes)

A test is passed if the number of successes rolled is at least equal to the number of successes required buy the test difficulty.
Additionally, the game uses the exploding dice rule: each time a player rolls a 10 on a D10, they can roll an additional die.

# Items & Equipment

### Equipment Starting in Play
Characters may start each encounter with any slotted equipment they have in play. For example, a player may start with their armor and weapons.

### Items & Equipment Slots
A player can only have one item in play at a time for each of the following slots: head, body, feet, left hand, and right hand. Weapons and shields specify “One-handed” or “Two-handed”. A player may have two one-handed items (e.g., a sword and a shield) or may have a single two-handed item (e.g., a long-bow). 

### Switching Equipment
If a player has equipment in their hand and already has equipment occupying that slot in play, the player may choose one of the following as a part of playing the new equipment: (a) discard the item in play or (b) return the item in play to the player's hand.

## Tilting & Refreshing 
Some items and equipment have the ability to “tilt”. When you tilt an item you rotate it 90 degrees to show that it’s special ability has been expended. Tilt abilities may only be used once-per-encounter, unless they are “refreshed” by another ability; for example, Second Wind states “Refresh all items you control.”

# Roleplaying
Legendfall is a collaborative game. Players get to know each other's characters and strategize. For example, a player might shout, “Elric, let’s flank the big guy.” As a general rule, each character can communicate 5-10 seconds worth of information to other characters during their turn and a few words as a free action outside their turn (e.g., “Let’s do it!”). Before players take actions they should think about how they can best collaborate and say what they need.

## Metagaming
Part of the fun of Legendfall is getting into character--seeing the world through your characters eyes. Often times there is information that you as a player might know that your character might not--when you leverage that information to gain an advantage, it’s called “Metagaming”. In general, this makes the game less fun. When a player needs help learning the game and understanding the rules, you should absolutely help them. However, you should try to return to your character's perspective after doing so. In general, you should avoid looking at each others cards (e.g., “If you play that, then I can play…”) and collaborating by talking about your strategy as players, instead of characters (e.g., “Stand in this square to be safe when I...”). The game rewards players who get into their characters and think about how their character would think. Do your best to try to stay “in character” as often as you can.
